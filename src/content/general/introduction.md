This site is a general documentation of my homelab from the hardware and in particular the software components I use. I have decided to make this documentation public to hopefully help others to avoid the pitfals I have stumbled upon. This is the reason each section contains resoning and justification for the choices I have made so that you can compare the pros and cons and make a decision for your case.

Another reason for these docs is that I have seen many times someone complaining about their homelab being attacked by ransomwares or hackers who have attacked it via exposed RDP/VPN ports or other components. Homelab is mostly about experimenting and playing with new and exciting toys which is absolutely fine. What I want to show is that even in a homelab, we can (and should) use approaches which are common in enterprise grade software development such as automation, vulnerability scanning etc. and that decent security doesn't have to be expensive or difficult.

The site allows you to publish comments and I would absolutely love to get feedback and spark discussions. I am not trying to say everything described here is the best way to do it and if you find a flaw or a better alternative I want to know about it!
