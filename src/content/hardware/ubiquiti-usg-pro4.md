USG-PRO4 is predecessor of the Ubiquiti Dream Machine, it's rack mountable and easily managed via [Unifi Controller](/selfhosted/unifi-controller). The only annoyance is lack of SFP ports for internal LAN. So far it's been running in my rack for about two years and I had to restart it once during that time when it started randomly misbehaving.
