US-24 is a 24-port managed (i.e. L3) switch. I bought a version without PoE because the PoE version was more than twice more expensive than this one at the time but it's been one of few regrets. I ended up having many more PoE devices than I anticipated and then ended up buying smaller PoE switches which make the setup more complicated.
