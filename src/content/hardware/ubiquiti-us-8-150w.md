US-8-150W is an 8-port PoE switch. Funny enough it's better than its successors which either have less PoE ports (lite version) or can handle load. The only drawback about this switch is that it's not officially supposed to be rack mounted because of the cooling. The switch itself has holes you can use to attach one rack ear but other one (the longer one) you have to buy yourself.
