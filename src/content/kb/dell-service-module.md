Dell Service module is required on 13th gen servers and later for communication between iDRAC and the OS. One of the features is that iDRAC pulls the hostname from the service module which is then displayed on the LCD display.

See the [external guide](https://techexpert.tips/dell-idrac/idrac-ism-installation-ubuntu-linux/) for detailed steps.
